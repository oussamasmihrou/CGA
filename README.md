# CGA : Custom Genetical Algorithm
It'sa custom optimisation algorithm,written in python using JupyteLAb, to find the optimal solution of a TSP problem.

# TSP Problem :


Your are an engineer working for Amazon, in the logistics departement. Imagine that Amazon wants to extend her buisness in a new country. You've been provided
with the matrix of distances between the coutry's citys. The TSP problem aims to find a shortest trajectory that a delivery agent can cross to visit all the cities
once.

There are a lot of local minimums given the amount of data, yet, this meta-heuristic keeps looing for an optimal solution till the running ends.

# What's new in CGA :

This algorithm is fully randomised ( mutations, evolution, solutions ) which makes it more ressemblant to the principe of genetic algorithms : The evolution principal of Dawin.

The app also holds some features like estimating the speed and the remaining time to execute to code.

I invite you to pullrequest the project to make the code better
