# CGA : Custom Genetical Algorithm

It's a custom optimization algorithm, written in python using JupyteLAb, to find the optimal solution to a TSP problem.



# TSP Problem :

You are an engineer working for Amazon, in the logistics department. Imagine that Amazon wants to extend its business in a new country. You've been provided

with the matrix of distances between the country's cities. The TSP problem aims to find one of the shortest trajectory that a delivery agent can cross to visit all the cities

once.

There are a lot of local minimums given the amount of data, yet, this meta-heuristic keeps looking for an optimal solution till the running ends.



# What's new in CGA :



This algorithm is fully randomized ( mutations, evolution, solutions ) which makes it more faithful to the principle of genetic algorithms: The evolution principle of Darwin.



The app also holds some features like estimating the speed and the remaining time to execute to code.



I invite you to pull request the project to make the code better
